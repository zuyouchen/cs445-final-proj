# CS445 Final Project

Basketball Image Detection

- `/src` contains the notebook file and dependencies in requirements.txt (for local running, we used a Python 3.12.7 `venv` on MacOS)
- `/results` contains images and videos that are results of running the object detection algorithm 
- `/data` contains the downloaded clips and videos and extracted frames we use as input
- The paper that this implementation is inspired by is DOI: 10.1109/ICPR.2006.122

TODO:
- Process more videos and save them to respective frame folders
- Get more intermediate results for NBA frames (when the ball is clearly seperable) and obtain incorrect results too for explanation, should have a reasonable amount given each persons' data collection
- (Innovation) canny edge detection method 
- Write-up on method
- List data sources (e.g., YouTube videos or clips from thehighlow)
